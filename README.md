# Getting and Cleaning Data 
## Course Project

The Goal of this project to prepare a well-labelled and tidy data from the raw data (labels are stored in separate files, separate train and test datasets, etc.) that was collected from accelerometers of Samsung Galaxy S smartphones (more about the raw data in http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones). 

This file describes how to re-produce the end-result of the project, which is the tidy data.

  * Download the zipped raw data from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip and unzip the file and rename the folder as "data"
